# Watch Your Garden Grow Biggly

Team project for We Can Code IT!  Developed in 2 weeks on a team of 7 practicing agile methodologies while creating a full stack Java Application.

Users are able to input their zip code and have returned to them a list of plants that are suitable to be planted in their area.  The users are then able to select their desired plants, then generate a planting report which provides the best dates to plant each one depending on the plant's specification and the last frost date for the user's zip code.
